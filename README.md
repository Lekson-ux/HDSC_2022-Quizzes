## Appliances Energy Prediction Using Machine Learning
A Linear regression model was developed to predict the energy appliances of some buildings with respect to their temperatures. Ridge and Lasso regression was also developed so as to improve the accuracy of the model. Hence, It was thereby discovered that  Lasso Regression helps in selecting important  features  for the prediction by shrinking the coefficient of  insignificant features to zero. :blush:
